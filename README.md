# scramble-word
Programming Assignment #8. Scrambles a word.

The scrambling process begins at the first letter of the word and continues from left to right.<br>
If two consecutive letters consist of an “A” followed by a letter that is not an “A”, then the two letters are swapped in the resulting string.<br>
Once the letters in two adjacent positions have been swapped, neither of those two positions can be involved in a future swap.<br>
